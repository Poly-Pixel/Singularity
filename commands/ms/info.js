        My Singularity is the feature of this bot that allows you to show off in a whole new way.
        Instead of just plain leveling, rank cards, and leaderboards, My Singularity allows you to, hence the name, build *YOUR OWN* black hole!

        By being active in a server, you can gain *protons* and *electrons*. These protons and electrons are a sort of currency in the My Singularity system. \
        You can use them to make your black hole bigger, or to trade them in for better items. The Developers (poly#3622 and Redstone#1165) will always be adding new features to My Singularity to keep your black hole growing!

        In addition to protons and electrons, you may get *dark matter*. This is an extremely rare substance, and can only be acquired naturally in 2 ways:
          
          **1.** While chatting, a unique and rare phenomenon called "quantum tunneling" may occur. When this occurs, you will recieve 1 Dark Matter.
          **2.** Once daily, you may "explore" to get a chance at getting dark matter. More information on this feature is in \`${serverDoc.prefix}ms explore\`.
          
        *Use \`${serverDoc.prefix}help ms\` to get a full list of My Singularity commands*
